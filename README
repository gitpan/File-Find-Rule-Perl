NAME
    File::Find::Rule::Perl - Common rules for searching for Perl things

SYNOPSIS
      use File::Find::Rule       ();
      use File::Find::Rule::Perl ();
  
      # Find all Perl files smaller than 10k
      my @files = File::Find::Rule->perl_file
                                  ->size('<10Ki')
                                  ->in( $dir );

DESCRIPTION
    I write a lot of things that muck with Perl files. And it always annoyed
    me that finding "perl files" requires a moderately complex
    File::Find::Rule pattern.

    File::Find::Rule::Perl provides methods for finding various Perl-related
    files.

METHODS
  perl_module
    The "perl_module" rule locates perl modules. That is, files that are
    named "*.pm".

    This rule is equivalent to "->"file->name( '*.pm' )> and is included
    primarily for completeness.

  perl_test
    The "perl_test" rule locates perl test scripts. That is, files that are
    named "*.t".

    This rule is equivalent to "->"file->name( '*.t' )> and is included
    primarily for completeness.

  perl_installer
    The "perl_installer" rule locates perl distribution installers. That is,
    it locates "Makefile.PL" and "Build.PL" files.

  perl_script
    The "perl_script" rule locates perl scripts.

    This is any file that ends in .pl, or any files without extensions that
    have a perl "hash-bang" line.

  perl_file
    The "perl_file" rule locates all files containing Perl code.

    This includes all the files matching the above "perl_module",
    "perl_test", "perl_installer" and "perl_script" rules.
