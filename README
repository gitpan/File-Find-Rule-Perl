NAME
    File::Find::Rule::Perl - Common rules for searching for Perl things

SYNOPSIS
      use File::Find::Rule       ();
      use File::Find::Rule::Perl ();
      
  # Find all Perl files smaller than 10k
      my @files = File::Find::Rule->perl_file
                                  ->size('<10Ki')
                                  ->in('dir');
      
  # Locate all the modules that PAUSE will index
      my @mod = File::Find::Rule->no_index
                                ->perl_module
                                ->in('My-Distribution');

DESCRIPTION
    I write a lot of things that muck with Perl files. And it always annoyed
    me that finding "perl files" requires a moderately complex
    File::Find::Rule pattern.

    File::Find::Rule::Perl provides methods for finding various types
    Perl-related files, or replicating search queries run on a distribution
    in various parts of the CPAN ecosystem.

METHODS
  perl_module
    The "perl_module" rule locates perl modules. That is, files that are
    named "*.pm".

    This rule is equivalent to "->"file->name( '*.pm' )> and is included
    primarily for completeness.

  perl_test
    The "perl_test" rule locates perl test scripts. That is, files that are
    named "*.t".

    This rule is equivalent to "->"file->name( '*.t' )> and is included
    primarily for completeness.

  perl_installer
    The "perl_installer" rule locates perl distribution installers. That is,
    it locates "Makefile.PL" and "Build.PL" files.

  perl_script
    The "perl_script" rule locates perl scripts.

    This is any file that ends in .pl, or any files without extensions that
    have a perl "hash-bang" line.

  perl_file
    The "perl_file" rule locates all files containing Perl code.

    This includes all the files matching the above "perl_module",
    "perl_test", "perl_installer" and "perl_script" rules.

  no_index
      # Provide the rules directly
      $rule->no_index(
          directory => [ 'inc', 't', 'examples' ],
          file      => [ 'Foo.pm', 'lib/Foo.pm' ],
      );
      
  # Provide a META.yml to use
      $rule->no_index( 'META.yml' );
      
  # Provide a dist root directory to look for a META.yml in
      $rule->no_index( 'My-Distribution' );
      
  # Automatically pick up a META.yml from the target directory
      $rule->no_index->in( 'My-Distribution' );

    The "no_index" method applies a set of rules as per the no_index section
    in a "META.yml" file.
